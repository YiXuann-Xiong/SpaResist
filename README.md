# SpaResist
SpaResist is a spatial transcriptomics pipeline for deconvolution, cancer cell state characterization, and drug resistance mechanism discovery.

# Spatial transcriptomics analysis pipeline (Visium HD) — RCTD + Harmony + clustering + DE + KEGG

This repository contains an end-to-end R pipeline for analyzing high-resolution spatial transcriptomics (10x Visium HD) data, including:
1) cell type deconvolution with **RCTD** using a scRNA-seq reference,
2) selection of **tumor-dominant** spots based on RCTD top-1 prediction,
3) batch correction using **Harmony** (Seurat v5 `HarmonyIntegration`),
4) clustering, marker detection, paired subset differential expression,
5) KEGG enrichment analysis.

The code is organized as a single script designed for transparency and reproducibility for peer review.

## Contents

- `analysis_pipeline.R`  
  Main pipeline script (RCTD → tumor spots → Harmony → clustering → DE → KEGG).
- `result/`  
  Output folder automatically generated by the script.
  - `all_markers.csv`  
  - `markers_S1320641_S1492809_1_vs_0.csv`  
  - `kegg_S1320641_S1492809_1_vs_0_up_markers.csv`  
  - `sessionInfo.txt`  

> Output filenames are configurable at the top of the script.

## Requirements

### R / OS
- R >= 4.2 is recommended (works with newer versions as well)

### R packages
The pipeline uses the following R packages:
- `Seurat` (v5+)
- `SeuratObject` (v5+)
- `harmony`
- `spacexr`
- `SpatialExperiment`, `SummarizedExperiment`
- `arrow` (for reading `.parquet`)
- `clusterProfiler`, `org.Hs.eg.db`

Install packages (example):

```r
install.packages(c("Seurat", "SeuratObject", "harmony", "arrow"))
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(c("SpatialExperiment", "SummarizedExperiment", "clusterProfiler", "org.Hs.eg.db"))
# spacexr is often installed from GitHub:
# remotes::install_github("dmcable/spacexr")
